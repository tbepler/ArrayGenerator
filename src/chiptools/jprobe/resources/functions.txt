chiptools.jprobe.function.peakfinder.PeakFinder	peakfinder	Genome	This function extracts ChIP-seq peak sequences from the genome.
chiptools.jprobe.function.probegenerator.ProbeGenerator	probegen	Chiptools	This function generates probes from peak sequences using Kmer data and a PWM for the factor of interest.
chiptools.jprobe.function.probejoiner.ProbeJoiner	probejoiner	Chiptools	This function takes existing probes and combines overlapping ones into multiple binding site probes.
chiptools.jprobe.function.bindingprofiler.BindingProfiler	bindingprofiler	Profile	This function takes existing probes and profiles them using specified KMers and/or PWMs.
chiptools.jprobe.function.probemutator.ProbeMutator	probemutator	Chiptools	This function takes existing probes and mutates them such that no Kmers outside of the binding site regions exceed a provided E-score cutoff.
chiptools.jprobe.function.probefilter.ProbeFilter	probefilter	Filter	This function filters probes based on the set of conditions passed to this function. The returned probes will be a subset of the given probes such that each probe in the subset passes all filters specified.
chiptools.jprobe.function.mutationprofiler.MutationProfiler	mutationprofiler	Profile	This function takes two sequences and a library of Kmers. For each Kmer it reports the E-scores of the words with the largest difference at each base that differs between the sequences.
chiptools.jprobe.function.peakfilter.PeakFilter	peakfilter	Filter	This function filters peaks based on the set of conditions passed. The returned peaks will be a subset of the given peaks such that each peak in the subset passes all filters specified. 
chiptools.jprobe.function.gcrunmutator.GCRunMutator	gcmutator	Chiptools	This function takes probes and an optional primer and mutates 5G or 5C runs on the probes by changing the center C to a G or vice versa.
