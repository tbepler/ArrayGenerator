Usage: probegen [-help] -k kmer_data -p PWM [-s] [--probeLength 36] [--bindingSite 9] [--window 3] [--escore 0.3] < sequences > probes

stdin: sequences that should be searched to create probes. each line must be formatted as (sequence \\s genomic_region \\s name [\\s other stuff ignored])
-k kmer_data: the kmer file to use for evaluating whether binding sites exceed the escore threshold
-p PWM: the pwm file to use for centering of probes within the window around the binding site
[--probeLength n]: the length of probes that should be generated, default = 36
[--bindingSite n]: the length of the binding sites that should exceed the escore threshold for a probe to be generated, default = 9
[--window n]: the number of nucleotides on either side of the binding site that should be scanned with the PWM to center the probe, default = 3
[--escore d]: the minimum escore of motifs spanning a sequence for the sequence to be considered a binding site
[-s]: suppresses progress output

stdout: probes in the format (sequence \\s genomic_region \\s name)
