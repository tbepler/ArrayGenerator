Usage: bindingprofile [-help] [-k kmer_files] [-p pwm_files] < sequences > score profiles

stdin: sequences that should be profiled using the given Kmers and/or PWMs. each line must be formatted as (sequence \\s genomic_region \\s name [\\s other stuff ignored])
[-k kmer_files]: the kmer files to use for scoring the sequences. multiple kmer files may be given separated by whitespace
[-p pwm_files]: the pwm files to use for scoring the sequence. multiple pwm files may be given separated by whitespace

stdout: score profiles in the format

seq1Name>
sequence1
file1 \t wordLength \t score1 \t score2 \t ...
file2 \t wordLength \t score1 \t score2 \t ...
